# monkey-portfolio

## What is a monkey portfolio?
There is a premise that if a monkey throws darts at a board with stock tickers, the resulting portfolio outperforms the underlying benchmark.

## What is the purpose of this project?
This project will enable you to generate your very own monkey portfolio and beat those measle S&P500 market returns!

## How was the data gathered?
The Nasdaq page offers a CSV with all its currently listed stock ticker. The backend processes this CSV file, and randomly selects 10 tickers.

## How can I access it?
The project is currently hosted on Netlify under: https://monkey-portfolio.netlify.app. Keep in mind, this is a WIP application, and I will be constantly making updates.
